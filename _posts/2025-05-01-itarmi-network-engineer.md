I currently deliver on-site network deployments and incident response across client environments in the UK.

## Highlights
- Deployed firewalls, routers, switches, and structured cabling across client sites.
- Monitored, triaged, and resolved network incidents with the NOC to restore service quickly.
- Executed approved change management procedures and documentation for audits and handovers.
